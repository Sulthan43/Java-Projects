The Hotel Reservation System is a console-based Java application developed to manage hotel room reservations efficiently. It uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interact with a MySQL database, allowing users to perform essential reservation operations such as booking rooms, viewing reservations, updating details, and deleting records.
This project demonstrates the practical use of Java, SQL, and database connectivity, making it suitable for academic projects, mini projects, and beginner-level backend learning.
